# README

This repository contains two projects pertaining to multispectral imaging/analysis using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 

- The "brain_tumor" directory contains a project that takes a multispectral cube centered on a pixel of interest. The goal is to classify that pixel as normal tissue or tumor tissue using supervised learning.

- The "sz" directory is a project that extracts the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from a multispectral patch of sky in the microwave bands.
